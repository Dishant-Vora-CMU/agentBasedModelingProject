# AI Futures: The Workforce Odyssey - Final Project Documentation
## Group 3

### Introduction
"AI Futures: The Workforce Odyssey" is an interactive agent-based simulation developed using AnyLogic. This project explores the interplay between artificial intelligence (AI), workers, corporations, and governmental policies. The simulation is designed to provide insights into how AI could reshape various facets of the workforce and inform strategic decisions in an era of technological transformation.

### Project Contents
- **AnyLogic Simulation Files**: Contains three comprehensive AnyLogic model files that simulate the dynamic interactions between agents representing workers, corporations, and government.
- **Video Recording**: A detailed video walkthrough of the simulation, demonstrating how different inputs affect outcomes and showcasing real-time agent interactions. Available for viewing [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N9xBEU1LFBVmiLWU8AggQqGZ-Q6EKG3v?usp=sharing).
- **Presentation Slides**: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the objectives, methodologies, key findings, and implications of the simulation results.
- **Final Report**: An extensive document providing a detailed analysis of the simulation design, implementation, results, and theoretical frameworks that support the findings.

### Detailed Descriptions
#### AnyLogic Simulation Files
Please run all the files together, the main file is named as the Phase-2-Worker-Final(1).alp
The simulation models are designed to replicate complex socio-economic interactions and test various scenarios under different AI integration strategies:
- **Worker Model**: Focuses on employment transitions, reskilling efforts, and adaptation to automation.
- **Corporate Model**: Examines the impact of AI on business operations, productivity, and workforce composition.
- **Government Model**: Explores regulatory responses to AI, including policy adaptations and their socio-economic impacts.

#### Video Recording
The video provides a visual demonstration of the simulation in action, with explanations of key features and scenarios. It serves as a guide to understanding how the simulation responds to different policy and corporate strategies.

#### Presentation Slides
The slides are designed to communicate the essential elements of the project succinctly:
- Project overview and motivation
- Methodology and agent-based modeling techniques
- Summary of key results and strategic implications
